## Next Steps

1. **Start with Prompt 16** (Profile Page) - This is the most critical missing piece
2. **Follow the priority order** - Each prompt builds on the previous ones
3. **Test after each prompt** - Ensure functionality works before moving on
4. **Focus on audit requirements** - Each prompt addresses specific audit points
5. **Maintain code quality** - Keep the existing modern UI and architecture

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days (Core functionality)
- Phase 2: 2-3 days (Enhanced features)
- Phase 3: 1-2 days (Deployment & polish)
- **Total: 5-8 days** for complete implementation

## Notes
- Current implementation has a solid foundation
- Focus on completing missing features rather than rebuilding
- Maintain the existing modern UI design
- Ensure all features work with real backend data
- Test thoroughly against audit requirements
